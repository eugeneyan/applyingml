I got started in ML because I was incredibly tired of manually analyzing data in order to make the same sorts of decisions every day. In a previous life I was a Process Engineer, developing tooling recipes in factories. This sort of job comes with a great deal of repetition within the scope of analyzing vast quantities of data that is collected from the processing tools. After analyzing that data, conclusions are drawn, and the next adjustments to the process are made in order to optimize the yield (how many good parts are coming out as a function of total parts submitted to the process). Because this is such an annoyingly repetitive and prescriptive process, I became incredibly bored with what my days were turning out to be filled with. I had the opportunity to learn from a partnership program that our company had with the SAS Institute, taking every single one of their instructor-led classes that were on offer. After learning the fundamentals, I started to apply them to progressively more projects (generally failing and getting in over my head in my ambitions over time). \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"After a few years and a few companies later, I ended up getting hired as a company\\u2019s first Data Scientist.

Working closely with subject matter experts to ensure that I was delivering exactly what they were expecting and looking for (applying Agile fundamentals to my project work helped here) through continuous iteration and improvement made these projects much more successful. After a year or so of building increasingly impactful and large-scale ML solutions on Apache Spark, I figured I\\u2019d try my hand at applying to Databricks.

The greatest impact that I make now is saving junior people from making all of the dumb mistakes that I\\u2019ve made in my career in DS. It\\u2019s remarkably fulfilling to see someone who, after less than a year of working with them and guiding them, is able to build solutions with ease that I would have struggled to build 5 years into my career. I absolutely adore letting everyone know how great that person is and how much they earned their recognition themselves (they put in the hard work, after all!).\"), mdx(\"h3\", {\n    \"id\": \"after-shipping-your-ml-project-how-do-you-monitor-performance-in-production-did-you-have-to-update-pipelines-or-retrain-modelshow-manual-or-automatic-was-this\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"h3\"\n  }, \"After shipping your ML project, how do you monitor performance in production?
