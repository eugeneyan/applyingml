I was fortunate enough to have circumstances that allowed me to do what I wanted and I did. I took up telecommunications engineering in my bachelors and picked up digital signal processing. The concepts within signal processing piqued my interest, which led to me coding a lot on Matlab. Back then Matlab was the preferred tool of choice and one could do a lot using it. That led me to a Master's degree in electrical engineering, where I realised one dimensional signal processing could lead to two-dimensional signal processing aka image processing. So, my Master's project was in image processing.

Data science teams are in my view, mini-startups in their own right.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"From the organisation's perspective, when building a data science team, one must take into consideration necessary functions that the team will need or be skilled in, such as science/mathematics, behavourial science, machine learning, data engineering & devops, stakeholder management, business knowledge/analysis, visualisation/user experience, etc. A big organisation that is introducing data science into their capability matrix, most likely will have most of these functions already, excluding science/mathematics, behavourial science and machine learning, spread across different business units. So, more likely than not they will embark on building a data science team with only scientists and machine learning engineers and call upon the pre-existing functions as and when required from other business units. However, I have not yet seen an instance of data science team built with this thinking be successful. Especially in a big and/or legacy organisation, it is quite important to seed and build a data science team as a start-up that encompasses all the required functions within itself until such point where data science is proven and widely used capability within the organisation.

This not only inspires data scientists to join your team but also is a strong motivator for data scientist to remain in the team/organisation.
